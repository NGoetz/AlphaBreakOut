# AlphaBreakOut
An physically correct BreakOutGame

Just click to start the BreakOut copy, providing infinite levels with each 50 bricks to break. By chance, bricks with different strength are
placed on the map. You have only on life per level. Each level, the ball gets faster.
The special point of this game: Not just reflections are physically correct, but also the interaction of paddle and ball. Wheras other
games just compute the reflection of the ball by the side it hits the paddle, this game simulates the friction between ball and paddle, that 
means, the speed you move the paddle in x-direction is transferred to the ball.
